          <h2>What is this? </h2>
          A small React component rendering a video with object-fit: cover,
          or a fallback if object-fit is not available.
          This is not a polyfill, it just creates a similar effect and it only works for videos.
          <h2> Why? </h2>
          There are existing object-fit polyfills:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/fitie"> fitie </a> by Jonathan Neal </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/anselmh/object-fit"> object-fit </a> by Anselm Hanneman </li>
          </ul>
          You should check them out.
          In comparison this component gives you a lot of control
          and probably works better in the context of a React application.
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          You should have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/tkloht/react-video-cover/blob/master/README.md">readme</a> and the <Link to="/resizable">examples</Link>.
          I also encourage you to have a look at the code, it should be relatively easy to understand.
          <div>If you have any questions or spot an error I would be glad to help.</div>
        </div>
      </Page>
